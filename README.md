# Overview
swr, is a software rasterizer/renderer.

# Building and running (only to see benchmark result)
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . # or make
./swr
```

# Notes
I spent my time on this for learning purposes, to understand how graphics APIs process vertices and how games/graphics were created in the 80s and 90s.
